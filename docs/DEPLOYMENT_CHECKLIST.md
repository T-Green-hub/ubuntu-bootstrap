# Deployment Readiness Checklist v0.2.0

## Security & Safety ✅

- [x] No hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets
- [x] All `rm -rf` commands have path validation
- [x] sudo usage is minimal and explicit via need_sudo()
- [x] File permissions are appropriate (755 for scripts)
- [x] All user inputs are validated before use

## Network Resilience ✅

- [x] All curl/wget calls have --retry flags (3 retries)
- [x] Timeouts configured (--connect-timeout 10)
- [x] Network preflight check before bootstrap
- [x] apt_safe wrapper with 6 retries
- [x] Graceful degradation on network failures

## Idempotency ✅

- [x] All scripts can be run multiple times safely
- [x] Package checks before installation
- [x] File/directory existence checks before creation
- [x] Service state checks before enable/disable
- [x] No destructive operations without verification

## Error Handling ✅

- [x] set -euo pipefail on all scripts
- [x] Critical vs non-critical failure handling (exit codes)
- [x] Meaningful error messages with context
- [x] STRICT=1 mode for zero-tolerance runs
- [x] Trap handlers for cleanup (apt guard restore)

## Logging & Observability ✅

- [x] Timestamped log entries throughout
- [x] Per-script log files in logs/<timestamp>/
- [x] LOG_DIR override capability
- [x] DRY_RUN mode for safe preview
- [x] Success/failure/skipped summary

## Lock Management ✅

- [x] apt/dpkg lock detection with fuser/lsof/pgrep fallbacks
- [x] Temporary stop of background services (PackageKit, unattended-upgrades)
- [x] Automatic restore via trap
- [x] 180s timeout with graceful proceeding
- [x] Respects DRY_RUN mode

## Hardware Support ✅

- [x] Multi-profile architecture (ThinkPad, HP, generic)
- [x] Auto-detection via dmidecode
- [x] Manual override (HARDWARE_PROFILE env var)
- [x] Fallback to /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/*
- [x] Conservative generic profile for unknowns

## Documentation ✅

- [x] README with badges and quick overview
- [x] QUICK_START with copy-paste examples
- [x] HARDWARE_PROFILES explaining detection
- [x] DRY_RUN usage guide
- [x] Inline comments in complex functions

## CI/CD ✅

- [x] GitHub Actions verify workflow
- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow (shellcheck, shfmt)
- [x] Syntax validation (bash -n)
- [x] Makefile targets for common tasks
- [x] Release automation with 'make release TAG=vX.Y.Z'

## User Experience ✅

- [x] --help flag with comprehensive usage
- [x] Version number in runner (0.2.0)
- [x] --skip-script=NN to skip individual scripts
- [x] Environment variables documented in help
- [x] Clear error messages with remediation hints

## Testing ✅

- [x] Syntax check passes (bash -n)
- [x] Dry-run mode validates without changes
- [x] Multiple test runs on target hardware
- [x] Network timeout scenarios handled
- [x] Lock contention scenarios addressed

## Known Limitations (Documented)

- 40_dev-tools.sh is monolithic (future: split 41-46)
- No rollback capability yet (future enhancement)
- No preflight system requirements check (future: 05_preflight.sh)
- shellcheck/shfmt warnings exist but don't block (future: strict mode)

## Deployment Decision: ✅ READY TO SHIP

All critical requirements met. Optional improvements documented for future releases.

## Next Steps

1. Commit: "feat: network resilience + safety hardening for v0.2.0"
2. Push to origin/main
3. Tag: v0.2.0
4. Create GitHub release with notes
5. Monitor CI workflows

## Post-Deployment

- Monitor GitHub Issues for user feedback
- Track CI/CD success rates
- Plan v0.3.0 roadmap (preflight checks, dev-tools split, rollback)
