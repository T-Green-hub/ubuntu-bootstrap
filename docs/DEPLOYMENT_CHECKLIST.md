- [x] File permissions are appropriate (755 for scripts)
- [x] All user inputs are validated before use

## Network Resilience ✅

- [x] All curl/wget calls have --retry flags (3 retries)
- [x] Timeouts configured (--connect-timeout 10)
- [x] Network preflight check before bootstrap
- [x] apt_safe wrapper with 6 retries
- [x] Graceful degradation on network failures

## Idempotency ✅

- [x] No destructive operations without verification

## Error Handling ✅

- [x] set -euo pipefail on all scripts
- [x] Critical vs non-critical failure handling (exit codes)
- [x] Meaningful error messages with context
- [x] STRICT=1 mode for zero-tolerance runs
- [x] Trap handlers for cleanup (apt guard restore)

## Logging & Observability ✅

- [x] Timestamped log entries throughout
- [x] Per-script log files in logs/<timestamp>/
- [x] LOG_DIR override capability
- [x] DRY_RUN mode for safe preview
- [x] Success/failure/skipped summary

## Lock Management ✅

- [x] apt/dpkg lock detection with fuser/lsof/pgrep fallbacks
- [x] Temporary stop of background services (PackageKit, unattended-upgrades)
- [x] Automatic restore via trap
- [x] 180s timeout with graceful proceeding
- [x] Respects DRY_RUN mode

## Hardware Support ✅

- [x] Multi-profile architecture (ThinkPad, HP, generic)
- [x] Auto-detection via dmidecode
- [x] Manual override (HARDWARE_PROFILE env var)
- [x] Fallback to /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/*
- [x] Conservative generic profile for unknowns

## Documentation ✅

- [x] README with badges, features, and beginner-friendly intro
- [x] QUICK_START with step-by-step guide for beginners
- [x] INSTALL.md with comprehensive installation guide
- [x] TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
- [x] HARDWARE_PROFILES explaining detection
- [x] DRY_RUN usage guide
- [x] Inline comments in complex functions

## CI/CD ✅

- [x] GitHub Actions verify workflow
- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow (shellcheck, shfmt)
- [x] Syntax validation (bash -n)
- [x] Makefile targets for common tasks
- [x] Release automation with 'make release TAG=vX.Y.Z'

## User Experience ✅

- [x] --help flag with comprehensive usage
- [x] Version number in runner (0.2.0)
- [x] --skip-script=NN to skip individual scripts
- [x] Environment variables documented in help
- [x] Clear error messages with remediation hints

## Testing ✅

- [x] Syntax check passes (bash -n)
- [x] Dry-run mode validates without changes
- [x] Multiple test runs on target hardware
- [x] Network timeout scenarios handled
- [x] Lock contention scenarios addressed

## Modular Architecture ✅

- [x] 40_dev-tools.sh refactored to modular design
- [x] Individual tool modules in scripts/dev-modules/
- [x] Selective tool installation support
- [x] Each module has install/uninstall stubs
- [x] Independent testing capability

## Known Limitations (Documented)

- Rollback functions are stubs (implementation planned for v1.1)
- shellcheck/shfmt warnings exist but don't block (non-critical)

## Deployment Decision: ✅ READY TO SHIP

All critical requirements met. Optional improvements documented for future releases.

## Next Steps

1. Commit: "docs: comprehensive beginner-friendly documentation for v1.0.0"
2. Push to origin/main
3. Tag: v1.0.0 (if not already tagged)
4. Update GitHub release notes if needed
5. Monitor CI workflows

## Post-Deployment

- Monitor GitHub Issues for user feedback
- Track CI/CD success rates
- Collect user feedback on documentation clarity
- Plan v1.1.0 roadmap (rollback implementation, additional profiles)
