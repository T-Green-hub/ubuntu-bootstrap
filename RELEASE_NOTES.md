# Ubuntu Bootstrap v1.0.1 - Release Notes

## ✨ Minor Release: ProtonVPN integration, privacy-first flow, post-install guide

### Highlights
- ProtonVPN: Improved installer UX, robust key/repo fallbacks, clear verification
- Privacy-first preset: `make privacy-first` installs ProtonVPN/Brave/TimeShift before dev tools

- Documentation: Quick Start updates and ProtonVPN guides (full + quick ref)

### Changes
- scripts/optional-features/protonvpn.sh: Stepwise logging, GPG key fallback, apt retry, uninstall polish
- scripts/optional-features/test_protonvpn.sh: Automated test suite
- scripts/99_verify.sh: ProtonVPN quick status when installed
- Makefile: `privacy-first` and `lint-light` targets
- docs: `PROTONVPN.md`, `PROTONVPN_QUICK_REF.md`, `POST_INSTALL.md`, cross-linked in README

### Quality
- make run: PASS (verified locally)
- make lint-light: PASS (bash -n on tracked .sh files)
- ProtonVPN tests: PASS

### Notes
- If you prefer privacy-first, use `make privacy-first`.
- For full linting, install shellcheck and run `make lint`.

# Ubuntu Bootstrap v1.0.0 - Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Release: Security Hardening & Modularization

### Overview
This release represents a comprehensive security audit and architectural refactoring of the ubuntu-bootstrap project. All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed, and the codebase has been modularized for improved maintainability.

---

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Critical Fixes
- **Eliminated curl|bash vulnerabilities** (4 instances)
  - All remote script executions now download to temp files first
  - Added safety checks and checksum validation
  
- **Replaced unsafe temp file handling**
  - All `/tmp/file-$$` patterns replaced with `mktemp`
  - Added proper cleanup with trap handlers
  
- **Path validation for destructive operations**
  - Added `validate_path()` helper for `rm -rf` operations
  - Double validation (string match + regex) before deletion

- **Removed hardcoded credentials**
  - Dynamic git user detection in `git_bootstrap.sh`
  - No sensitive data in repository

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Error checking for all network downloads (curl/wget)
- Version format validation for downloaded packages
- Comprehensive error messages with context
- Individual tool failure tracking and reporting

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Changes

### Modularization
**scripts/40_dev-tools.sh** has been refactored from monolithic (419 lines) to modular architecture:

```
scripts/dev-modules/
├── docker.sh       - Docker installation
├── nodejs.sh       - Node.js/nvm installation
├── python.sh       - Python/pyenv installation
├── rust.sh         - Rust/rustup installation
├── go.sh           - Go language installation
├── vscode.sh       - VS Code installation
└── utilities.sh    - Dev utilities (jq, ripgrep, etc.)
```

**Benefits:**
- Each module is independently testable
- Easy to add/remove tools
- Better separation of concerns
- Selective installation support: `./40_dev-tools.sh docker nodejs`

### Uninstall/Rollback Framework
- Each module now includes `uninstall_<tool>` stub functions
- Foundation for automatic rollback on failures
- Future-ready for advanced validation

---
